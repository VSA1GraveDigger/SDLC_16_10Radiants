# INTRODUCTION

This project is based on Simple Aurdino Home Automation with Gas and water level sensors.It is used to sense motion,temperature and light and Response according to it.It also used to detect  the leakage of gas and used to measure the water level.Gas leakage is a serious problem and nowadays it is observed in many places like residences,industries, and vehicles like Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), buses, cars, etc. It is noticed that due to gas leakage, dangerous accidents occur.

# RESEARCH

The aim of this project is to propose and discuss a design of a gas leakage detection system that can automatically detect, alert and control gas leakage. This proposed system also includes an alerting system for the users. The system is based on a sensor that
easily detects a gas leakage. A gas leakage detector becomes vital and helps to protect people from the dangers of
gas leakage. A number of research project have been published on gas leakage detection techniques.
